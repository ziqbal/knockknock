# knockknock


KnockKnock with sequence memory

This experiment uses a piezo buzzer as a vibration sensor wired to an analog input.
Don't get confused with the piezo sensor as input and piezo buzzer as output!
Code must be changed if you use a standard button on a regular digital pin.
Also, be sure what kind of sound buzzer you have, is it an active or passive sound buzzer?
This experiment uses a passive sound buzzer.

The knock sensor is a piezo buzzer coupled with a resistor and diodes to protect the arduino pins.
